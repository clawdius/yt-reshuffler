## Why?
Youtube default playlist shuffler sucks, my playlist has 1000+ songs and the shuffler died before shuffling my entire playlist, so I made those online "Youtube Randomizer" thing for desktop, powered by [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) type shii ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.

Heavily inspired <sup><sub>(probably the only reason, to be honest)</sub></sup> by "[Youtube Playlist Randomizer](https://youtube-playlist-randomizer.bitbucket.io/)", big thanks to whoever made that masterpiece.
