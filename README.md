## # Why?
Youtube default playlist shuffler sucks, my playlist has 1000+ songs and the shuffler died before shuffling my entire playlist, so I made those online "Youtube Randomizer" thing for desktop, powered by [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) type shii ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.

Heavily inspired <sup><sub>(probably the only reason, to be honest)</sub></sup> by [Youtube Playlist Randomizer](https://youtube-playlist-randomizer.bitbucket.io/), big thanks to whoever made that masterpiece.

## # (Not so) Frequently Asked Questions
### > Why Electron?
I don't want to open my chrome with a gazillion extensions just to listen to [Didn't See That Coming](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=t7zWExFJL5I) by Quinten Coblentz.
Besides, I just want to learn Electron. **You learn new technology by making something with it, right?**

### > Using Json to save things in the big 25? There's this technology called `database`, my guy. ðŸ¥€ðŸ¥€
No thanks, using portable DB such as `sqlite` is overrated.

### > Why the heck do I need Express? I thought this is a "client-only" app?
Youtube's embed gets mad if we directly use it with `file:///` protocol.
Default Electron's way to open / load a file (as far as I know) is directly call the file via `file:///` protocol or `loadURL()`.
Express is here just to serve static files, so it will use `loadURL()` and use the `localhost` protocol, thus the Youtube's embed will stop whining. Nothing fancy handy magic thing going on here.

### > The UI sucks, the icons are disproportionate, learn how to do UI/UX!
This isn't even a question. I love to make sure the program run first, then beautify it, not the other way around.

### > When will you build the app into a final product?
I aim to make the basic player utility (player control, multiple playlist support, etc.) to be ready first.

### > Can I use your Youtube API key?
No.
