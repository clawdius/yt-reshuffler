Youtube default playlist shuffler sucks, my playlist has 1000++ songs and the shuffler died even before shuffling my entire playlist, so I made those online "Youtube Randomizer" thing for desktop, powered by Electron shii.

Heavily inspired (probably the only reason) by ["Youtube Playlist Randomizer"](https://youtube-playlist-randomizer.bitbucket.io/), big thanks to whoever made that masterpiece.
